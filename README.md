# AEO/GEO Audit System

An agentic system that audits how AI search — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude — **discovers, names, and describes a company**, then ships a client-ready report.

Built by [Lobo Growth](https://lobogrowth.com). This repo is a public showcase of the architecture: the LLM judgment agents, the deterministic measurement harness, and a fully worked **synthetic example** (`companies/northwind/`) so you can see real inputs and outputs without any client data.

> **Why this exists.** "SEO for AI" (AEO = Answer Engine Optimization, GEO = Generative Engine Optimization) is mostly vibes and vanity metrics. This system makes it measurable: it runs real prompts against real answer engines, grades each answer against the brand's own positioning, and separates two failure modes most tools blur together.

## The one idea: two jobs, never averaged

A company can fail AI search in two distinct ways, and the fix for each is different:

| Job | Question it answers | "Broken" looks like |
|-----|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Discoverability** | When a buyer asks a *category* question ("best stablecoin payouts API?"), is the company **named** at all? | Competitors fill the answer; the company isn't in the room. |
| **Assessment** | When a buyer asks about the company **by name**, is it described **accurately and favorably**? | Wrong entity, stale facts, miscategorized, hallucinated products. |

The scores are reported **separately and never averaged** — averaging hides which job is broken, and the report leads with that verdict. The wedge metric is a per-answer **Performance Score**: each model answer is graded against the brand's *own* positioning and the prompt's success criteria, not a generic rubric.

## Four levers, scored and ranked (v2.3)

The jobs are outcomes; everything a company can fix sorts into four mechanism-ordered levers — before AI can recommend you, it has to **read you, know you, quote you, and hear others vouch for you**:

| Lever | Question | Owner |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Access** | Can a machine read you? (bot access, raw-HTML fetchability, the Bing/Brave indexes that gate ChatGPT/Claude search) | Eng |
| **Identity** | Does AI know who you are? (canonical company/offering pages, entity schema, name binding, Wikipedia) | Brand |
| **Content** | Are you a source worth quoting? (original research, category guides, comparison pages, freshness) | Content |
| **Reputation** | Do trusted third parties vouch for you? (earned press, the roundups AI actually cites, validation sources) | PR |

~27 elements with written 0-5 anchor ladders (`lib/rubric.mjs`), gated by a company-archetype profile (enterprise B2B is not judged like PLG SaaS; inapplicable elements are N/A, never zeroed). Three design rules make the numbers defensible:

- **Freeze-then-score.** Evidence gathering writes facts ledgers (every fact carries a URL and check date, never a score); scoring is a separate deterministic pass over the frozen ledgers — mechanical in code where possible, judged at temperature 0 against the anchors where not, with verbatim evidence quotes validated by substring match.
- **Judge-then-score.** The performance grader emits per-criterion pass/partial/fail verdicts with quotes — never a number. `grade-compute.mjs` validates every quote against the response text, applies the floor gate (brand named + right entity + no kill-criterion failure), and computes scores in code. Unsure or quote-invalid verdicts queue for human adjudication.
- **Theory vs practice.** Every element gets an **importance score**: an evidence-tier prior from the published research, blended 50/50 with the observed citation signal in this company's own measured answers (which roundups did the models actually cite? whose product pages won the category answers?). **Priority = importance x gap** ranks the fix list — so the #1 fix is provably the thing AI already uses that the company is weakest at.

See [`.claude/context/aeo-audit-framework.md`](.claude/context/aeo-audit-framework.md) for the full methodology.

## How it runs — 3 phases, 2 human gates

Each phase is a slash command (`.claude/commands/`) that orchestrates agents and then **stops at a gate** for human review. Nothing auto-advances.

```
/audit-prep  <Company> <domain>   research + pin entity + draft test prompts   ── Gate 1: approve prompts
/audit-run   <slug>               query 3 surfaces + 3 audits + grade          ── Gate 2: approve findings
/audit-report <slug>              compile the client report
/audit-publish <slug>             (deployment-specific) push report live
```

## Architecture

**Deterministic harness** (Node, native `fetch`, zero dependencies) — the parts that must be reproducible:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `run-prompts.mjs` + `lib/surfaces.mjs`, `lib/openrouter.mjs` | Query Claude, Perplexity, and ChatGPT via OpenRouter (web search on, k runs per prompt, retries + honest error rows) → `raw_responses.jsonl` |
| `classify.mjs` | Tag each answer (brand mentioned? own domain cited?), type every citation (competitor / listicle / press / reference / explainer), and extract the **answer-derived consideration set** that feeds share-of-voice → `classified.jsonl`, `consideration.json` |
| `access-checks.mjs` | Robots rules per AI-bot class (training vs search vs user-fetch), live user-agent probes for edge blocks, Bing + Brave index presence → `access.json` |
| `site-checks.mjs` | Frozen page sample + scripted onsite facts (raw-HTML fetchability, crawl coverage, schema, freshness, FAQ/pricing presence) → `site-facts.json` |
| `grade-compute.mjs` | Validates every grader quote against the response, applies the floor gate, computes Performance Scores in code → `graded.jsonl`, `review-queue.json` |
| `compute-metrics.mjs` | Mention/citation rates, per-prompt k/n counts, blended + portrayal-when-named performance, criterion failure rates, share-of-voice → `metrics.json` |
| `score-levers.mjs` | Scores the four levers across ~27 anchored elements over the frozen facts ledgers; computes importance + the priority ranking → `levers.json` |
| `build-deck.mjs` | Flattens everything into the `[[token]]` dataset the client deck is filled from → `canva-fill.json` |
| `prose-lint.mjs` | High-precision AI-writing-tell linter; hard-fails on em dashes |
| `lib/rubric.mjs` | The framework encoded: element registry, anchor ladders, archetype profiles, importance weights |

**LLM judgment agents** (`.claude/agents/`) — the parts that need reasoning:

| Agent | Job |
|-------|-----|
| `audit-context-gatherer` | Research the company, pin the exact entity + archetype profile, write `context.md` |
| `audit-prompt-definer` | Draft the test prompts + the per-criterion grading rubric (weight/kill) — the Gate 1 artifact |
| `audit-offsite-evidence` | Facts ledger for the Reputation lever + off-site Identity (press, roundups, validation sources, directories, Wikipedia) — facts with URLs, never scores |
| `audit-onsite-evidence` | Facts ledger for the Content lever + on-site Identity (guides, comparisons, case studies, research assets, blog composition) |
| `audit-performance-grader` | **The wedge** — per-criterion verdicts with verbatim quotes; the score itself is computed in code |
| `audit-insights-stager` | Synthesizes everything into the verdict, two scorecards, and the priority-ranked fix list (Gate 2) |
| `audit-report-writer` | Writes the client-facing HTML report, led by the verdict |

The split is deliberate: anything that should be reproducible and cheap is a deterministic script; anything that needs judgment is an agent grounded by a shared methodology file.

## The worked example — `companies/northwind/`

A complete audit of a **fictional** company, **Northwind Pay** (a stablecoin payments API). Every number, finding, and quote is synthetic — see the banner in `companies/northwind/context.md`. Real companies appear only as market-context competitors.

Open [`companies/northwind/report.html`](companies/northwind/report.html) in a browser for the final deliverable. The verdict it lands on: **discoverability is broken, assessment is strong** — Northwind is described accurately when asked by name (4.3/5, named in 100% of answers) but barely surfaces in category questions (1.7/5, named in 3 of 9). The supporting artifacts show every step that produced it: `prompts.json` → `raw_responses.jsonl` → `classified.jsonl` + `consideration.json` → `graded.jsonl` → `metrics.json` → `access.json` + **`levers.json`** (the four-lever scorecard with anchors, importance, and the priority ranking) → `findings.json` + `deck-overrides.json`. A few artifacts predate the current shapes; `levers.json` and `consideration.json` show the v2.3 scoring layer.

## Running it yourself

The agents and commands are designed for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). The harness scripts run with plain Node.

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # add your OpenRouter key
npm run test:surfaces         # re-queries the surfaces for the example slug
node classify.mjs northwind   # + consideration-set extraction with the key set
node compute-metrics.mjs northwind
node build-deck.mjs northwind # flattens everything into the deck-fill tokens
```

The `/audit-publish` phase is wired to one specific deployment (Canva + Netlify + a custom host) and is included as a documented stub — phases 1–3 produce all the analysis and a self-contained `report.html`.
